# Welcome to ClubPython

### ClubPython is a Slack Group filled with individuals who want to take their programming skills to the next level.

Learning to code is hard. If you're like us, then chances are you've gone through a Python Course or two (or seven) on
Codeacademy, Udacity, edX, Udemy, Coursera or one of 100 other options out there. You've looked into books like 'Learn
Python the Hard Way' and 'Automate the boring Stuff', and you've probably tried some really cool stuff I haven't even
heard of.

You know the Python basics. You know about strings, lists and dictionaries. You know how to use for loops and functions.
You've probably built a simple script or two, maybe a text game in the command line and you're ready to move on to what's
next. You want to take what you've learned so far and actually build something! The problem is, despite all your previous
training and practice, you're not really sure where to start. How do you go from simple scripts to a building a website?  
How do you build an application that you can share with other people?

In my experience, as well as the experience of others who I have spoken with. This isn't immediately clear after you get
the basics down. You want to take yourself from beginner to intermediate, and beyond! But there is always something
dragging you down. You keep running into errors that no matter how many times you google you can't find the right answers
to solve them. You get stuck, you lose motivation, and before long you give up. Only to repeat the cycle again 6 months
or a year from now because you really enjoy coding and building things, but you wonder if you're really cut out for it.

I've come to the conclusion that there is a significant gap in required knowledge that almost every beginner faces when
they reach "the end of the tutorial". I've seen this 100 times in one form or another. People ask "Ok, I've finished this
book and that tutorial, what should I do next?" and the answer is always some variation of "Build a website!", "Start your
own project!", "Make a game", etc. When you, the rookie, encounter this for the first time you're thinking "Well, if I knew
how to do that do you think I'd be asking what to do next?". This is wear a lot of people drop off and give up unless they
get lucky and find a project that is interesting enough to keep your attention, yet within reach of your skillset so you 
don't feel lost.

###That's where ClubPython comes in!

We have created a community for mentoring and learning. There is enough structure, to always give you something to work on.
There is enough knowledge between us, that you can always find the answer you're looking for. And we build things together.

There are quirky group projects that are engaging and fun.
There are projects that solve real world problems, that we encounter in our community.
There are projects and tasks for people at all skill levels. Beginner to Master. 

We even have tasks for people with 0 functional programming knowledge that you can help with and begin to learn the basic
frameworks, processes and systems that we use as software developers. As you gain experience, you will be given opportunities
to tackle new problems that take advantage of the latest programming skills you have acquired. 

The greatest part about our community is that anyone can help with anything! If you're already more experienced, you can help
others get up to speed. If you just want to code, you can code all day everyday. You'll be learning important skills that are
often required for gaining employement as a developer (Git, Version Control, Code Review, Pair Programming, etc). You'll learn
how to work in a team coding enviroment. You'll be gaining the the skills you need to get the jobs and then kick ass at the 
jobs.

As a member of our community we offer:
- Code Reviews
- One on one training sessions
- Live streams on group projects
- Friendship and Karate for everyone.
- Project ideas within your skillset
- Partners to work on projects together that match your interests
- SlackBots for dayzzzzz
- And more. So much more.

### How do you get involved?
While reading this, if you have found yourself saying yes....yes....omg yes! over and over again. Then you're in the right place.
Join the slack group by following the link below and answering a few questions about your Python/Programming experience, your
current environment and setup (OS, Python version, editor, etc), what you'd like to learn and what you'd like to build. We use
these answers to stay as organized as possible as a group. They help us match you up with mentors and potential partners for small
projects and pair programming exercises. The info will also be available in your profile, so as new members are joining all the time
everyone will have a little background information to help the process.  
  
I hope you're excited as we are, because it's about to get (fire)(fire)(fire)
